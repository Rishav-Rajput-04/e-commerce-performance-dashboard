   - With total sales of ₹78.57M and 113K orders, the average order value of ₹696.17 indicates a healthy per-transaction revenue.
   - The B2B sales percentage of 75% suggests a strong focus on business customers, which may impact marketing and sales strategies.

2. **Fulfillment Efficiency:**
   - The Amazon Fulfillment Rate of 0.69 indicates that a significant portion of orders are fulfilled through Amazon's services, potentially benefiting from their logistics network.
   - With 109K shipped orders out of 113K total, the fulfillment process appears efficient, but there's room for improvement in reducing unshipped and on-the-way orders.

3. **Product Category Insights:**
   - T-shirts, shirts, and blazers are the top-selling categories, suggesting areas for potential inventory focus and marketing efforts.
   - The preference for expedited shipping across most categories indicates customers value quick delivery, which could be leveraged for premium shipping options or loyalty programs.

4. **Inventory Management:**
   - The popularity of L and XL sizes across products highlights the importance of maintaining adequate stock in these sizes to meet demand.

5. **Sales Trends:**
   - The fluctuating sales trend over time suggests potential for targeted promotional activities during typically lower-performing periods to boost sales.
